Developing a workflow using Luigi.

To my understanding the problem is defined as following steps.
  1. Spilt the metadata files based on the genre of the movie into 3 category Comedy, Romance and Others.
  2. Find the average revenue from comedy genre file.
  3. Find the average runtime from romance genre file.
  4. Find the average popularity from the other genre file.
  5. Collect the average revenue, runtime and popularity and write in the final csv file.
